ðŸš¨ **Note:** This guide assumes a Windows OS.

## Description

#### The Classic Wordle Challenge 
In ***WordGuesser***, you'll be presented with a secret word that you need to guess correctly within a limited number of attempts. 
Each time you guess a letter, you'll receive feedback on whether the letter is in the word and if it's in the correct position. 
Use this feedback to strategically deduce the hidden word.

#### Web Scraper Feature
One of the standout features of ***WordGuesser*** is its built-in web scraper. The web scraper roams various websites, collecting a treasure trove of words and their definitions. 
It enriches the game by providing you with not just a list of words but also their meanings. This feature not only enhances your gameplay but also offers a valuable learning experience.
